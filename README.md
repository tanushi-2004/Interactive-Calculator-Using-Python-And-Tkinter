# Interactive-Calculator-using-Python-and-Tkinter

This repository contains two Python scripts that implement a basic calculator application using Tkinter. Both scripts provide a graphical user interface (GUI) for performing arithmetic operations.

# Features

- Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Evaluation of mathematical expressions
- Clear button to reset the input

###Code Overview

### Code 1

-   **Functionality**: Implements a calculator with hardcoded buttons for digits (1-9), arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /), percentage (%), decimal point (.),     equals (=), and clear (C).
-   **Layout**: Uses a grid layout to position buttons and display the result.

### Code 2

-   **Functionality**: Similar to Code 1 but uses a loop to dynamically create digit buttons (0-9). 
-   **Layout**: Buttons are dynamically created and positioned using loops, reducing redundancy in the code.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ChaitanyaNarang28/Interactive-Calculator-using-Python-and-Tkinter.git
    ```
3. Navigate to the repository directory:
    ```bash
    cd Interactive-Calculator-using-Python-and-Tkinter
    ```
4. Run the desired Python script using:
    ```bash
    python script_name.py
    ```
   Replace `script_name.py` with the appropriate script filename (`code1.py` or `code2.py`).

## Usage

- Launch the application by running the script.
- Click the buttons to perform calculations.
- Use the clear button (C) to reset the input.
- The equals button (=) displays the result of the expression.
